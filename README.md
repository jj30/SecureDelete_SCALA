Scala implementation of AES-512 bit encryption

These files are a scala implementation of 512-bit AES encryption. In order to get a 512 bit key, you need to install the Java Cryptography Extension files at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html. Otherwise you get an 'illegal key size' exception.

One of the files is Jasypt DES, obviously a step towards Triple DES.
